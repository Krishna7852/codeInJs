// Two Number Sum

/**
 Write a function that takes in a non-empty array of distinct integers
and an integer representing a target sum. If any two numbers in the 
input array sum up to the target sum, the function should return them 
in an array, in any order. If no two numbers sum up to the target sum, 
the function should return an empty array.\n\nNote that the target sum 
has to be obtained by summing two different integers in the array; 
you can't add a single integer to itself in order to obtain the target 
sum.\n\nYou can assume that there will be at most one pair of numbers
 summing up to the target sum.
 *
 * Sample Input:
 array = [3, 5, -4, 8, 11, 1, -1, 6];
 targetSum = 10;

 * Sample Output[-1, 11] // the numbers could be in reverse order"
 *
